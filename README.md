# ADS1115 Device Library
 
 ---

 The AS1115 device library is a test library for the ADS1115 16bit analog converter.  This library makes use of Jeff Rowberg's i2cdevlib for rasbery pi and is modeled after his MPU6050 library.  All code is experimental and for testing purposes only!  Use at your own risk.
